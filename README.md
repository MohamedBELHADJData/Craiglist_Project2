# 🚗     Craiglist Used Car Market — Data Pipeline & Analysis

This repository contains a full data science pipeline built to extract, clean, enrich, and analyze used car listings from Craiglist. The project aims to model the second-hand automotive market in the United States by combining web scraping, domain-based normalization, and exploratory data science techniques.

## 📌 Project Overview

- 🔍 **Scraping**: Automated extraction of car listings across multiple Craiglist subdomains with handling of dynamic web content.
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning**: Cleaning inconsistent or incomplete fields with domain-specific rules and imputation logic.
- 🧾 **Model Normalization**: Mapping messy `makemodel` strings to a canonical structure using a reference JSON database (e.g. `{ make: [model1, model2, ...] }`).
- 📊 **Market Analysis**: Statistical exploration and visualization of the US used car market (price distribution, location trends, supply by brand/model).
- 🤖 **Data Science**:
  - Price prediction models
  - Clustering of listings by technical and economic features
  - Anomaly detection to identify outliers or suspicious listings
